<p>Welcome {{ username }} !</p>
<p>This application is a secure, user-friendly web platform that allows registered users to log in and upload CSV files for data processing. 
    Built using Flask and MySQL, the app features a login and session management system to ensure only authenticated users can access its core functionality. 
    Once logged in, users can upload CSV files, which are then cleaned and processed for analysis or visualization. 
    The goal is to provide a simple but powerful interface for users to manage and interact with their data, 
    while ensuring scalability for future enhancements, such as integration with Azure databases or advanced analytics tools.</p>
<p>The application begins with a user login system where credentials are verified against a MySQL database. 
   Once authenticated, users are granted access to the main dashboard where they can upload CSV files. 
   Upon upload, the file is securely saved on the server and processed using pandas. 
   The system automatically cleans the data by removing empty rows, standardizing column names, and trimming unnecessary whitespace. 
   A preview of the cleaned data is then displayed in a structured, styled HTML table, giving users a quick insight into their dataset. 
   Additional features such as labeling documents, storing them in Azure, and extended user profiles can be added to enhance the functionality further. 
   The app uses Flask sessions to manage user state, ensuring personalized and secure access throughout the experience.</p>
